factory pattern
---
The factory pattern is a design pattern used to create objects in software development.When the program runs into a "type", the corresponding object needs to be created.That's the factory model.In this case, the implementation code is based on the factory pattern and can be scalable, maintainable code.When a new type is added, there is no need to modify the existing classes, only to add subclasses that generate new types.
